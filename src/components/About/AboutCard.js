            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Muhammad Huzaifa </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Wah Cantt, Pakistan.</span>
            <br />
             currently studying Computer Science at COMSATS University, and happily drowning in code (on purpose).
            <br />
            Iâ€™m not working at a big tech companyâ€¦ yet ðŸ˜Ž
            <br />
            But Iâ€™ve been busy learning, <span className="purple">building, breaking, and rebuilding</span> â€” mostly in the world of web development, with a soft spot for <span className="purple">Blockchain, React, Node.js</span>, and all things <span className="purple">JavaScript.</span>
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
