# 🚀 Huzaifa's Portfolio

Welcome to my digital playground! This is a modern, fun, and fully responsive portfolio built with React, where I show off my projects, skills, and a little bit of my personality (and maybe too many purple gradients). Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow dev, or just lost on the internet—you're in for a treat!

## 🧑‍💻 About This Project

This portfolio is a single-page React app (with multi-page vibes thanks to React Router) that features:

- ✨ A snazzy animated homepage (particles, typewriter, and a waving hand included)

- 🛠️ Projects gallery with detailed cards, images, and links to code & demos
- 📄 Resume viewer and instant download (PDF magic!)
- 🌈 Custom CSS and React-Bootstrap for a beautiful, responsive UI
- 🎉 Preloader, smooth scroll, and a sticky navbar for that extra polish
